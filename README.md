# JrtStorage
JrtStorage is an abstraction layer for filesystems or distributed filesystem . JrtStorage provides a common way of accessing entire filesystems. You can write platform-independent code to work with local files, that also works with any of the supported filesystems (local file system, Aliyun OSS S3 etc.).


Supported Filesystems
---------------------

Here are a few of the filesystems that can be accessed with Pyfilesystem:

* **Local FileSystem** access files & directories on local fileSystem
* **AliYun OSS** access files & directories on AliYun OSS
* **JrtFS** access files & directories stored in JrtFS server
